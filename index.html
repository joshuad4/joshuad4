## Introduction

For this assignment I opted to use the GDP dataset that I used in a previous assignment. I was able to open the data using Idyll's built in table data component so that I could preview the dataset.




[data name:"gdp" source:"GDP.csv" /]

[Table data:gdp /]

Following this I was able to use vega-lite to create a plot that demonstrates how this GDP has changed over time.

[IdyllVegaLite data:gdp spec:`{
  mark: "line",
  encoding: {
    x: {
      field: "DATE",
      type: "temporal",
      axis: {title: "Date", format:"%YYYY%MM%DD"}
    },
    y: {
      field: "GDP",
      type: "quantitative",
      axis: {title: "GDP"},
      
    }
  }
}` /]
